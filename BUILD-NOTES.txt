Notes on building the kernel packages for Ubuntu.

Update the version in debian.master/changelog
Build package: dpkg-buildpackage

Running "clean" removes ABI files needed by the next version; don't run clean after building the final release version. (dpkg-buildpackage -Tclean)

After a build (and dpkg-buildpackage -Tclean), the following directories can be delete:
debian/d-i-amd64

After a build, check in the following files/directories:
debian.master/abi/<version>

TODO:
remove debian/d-i-amd64 as part of the 'clean' target.
clean up perl errors when running 'clean' target.
