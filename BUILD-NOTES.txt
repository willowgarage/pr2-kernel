Notes on building the kernel packages for Ubuntu.

Update the version in debian.master/changelog
Build package: dpkg-buildpackage

Running "clean" removes ABI files needed by the next version; don't run clean after building the final release version. (dpkg-buildpackage -Tclean)

Build-generated files required for subsequent builds:
debian.master/abi/<oldversion>

After a build, check in the following files/directories:
debian.master/abi/<version>
